# ZX81-graphics-library
Fast low-res 3D graphics for the ZX81

p-files can be loaded staight into the EightyOne emulator (select 16K ram)
You will need to install the TASM assembler: https://www.cpcalive.com/docs/TASMMAN.HTM  if you want to compile them yourself. I am running Version 3.2 September, 2001. on Windows 11.
